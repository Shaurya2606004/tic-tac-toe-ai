# Tic-Tac-Toe with Unbeatable AI

A simple yet powerful **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **Python** and the **Tkinter** library for the graphical user interface (GUI). This version of the game features an **unbeatable AI** powered by the **Minimax algorithm**, making it impossible for the player to win unless they play perfectly.

## Features

- **Unbeatable AI**: The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to determine the best move, ensuring it plays optimally.
- **Graphical User Interface**: A clean and simple 3x3 grid interface created using **Tkinter**.
- **Game State Management**: The game can detect win conditions, draw conditions, and reset the game after each round.
- **Human vs. AI**: Players can compete against the AI, which will always make the best possible moves.
- **Simple Reset**: After a game is completed (win/draw), you can start a new game with a simple click.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the zip file.
2. Install Python 3.x if it's not already installed.
3. Run the Python script `tic_tac_toe.py`.
4. The game will launch in a new window where you can click on the grid to make your moves.
5. The AI will make its move after each player turn. The goal is to try and beat the unbeatable AI! (Hint: Itâ€™s difficult, but not impossible.)
